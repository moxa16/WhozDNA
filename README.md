DNA in humans and chimpanzees are studied and classified into seven different types of proteins that are common in both humans and chimpanzees using the protein sequence data.

These 7 labels include:
1. 'G protein coupled receptors',
2. 'Tyrosine Kinase',
3. 'Tyrosine phosphatase',
4. 'Synthetase', 'Synthase',
5. 'Ion channel',
6. 'Transcription Factor'

This is done using machine learning algorithms like RandomForest , DecisionTree , XGBoost and Multinomial classification Algorithms.

Accuracy obtained for both humans and chimps is 97.8 % and 89.7% respectively with Multinomial Naive bayes classifier.
